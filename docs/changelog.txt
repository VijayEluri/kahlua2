Kahlua 2
----------

Incompatible changes from Kahlua
--------------------------------
* Removed "next" and reworked tables entirely.
* Changed __mode to no longer support weak tables.
* Changed lua 5.1 table semantics:
  * -0 == 0 for keys in tables is no longer true
  * tables may now use NaN as key.

New features
------------
* Concurrency support - different LuaThreads may share data (such as the environment).
* Platform abstraction - J2SE and J2ME now uses completely different implementations for some tasks.
* New GUI example interpreter - play around with Kahlua interactively, with syntax highlighting and auto-complete.
* Coroutines can be shared between threads as long as both threads don't try to resume at the same time.
